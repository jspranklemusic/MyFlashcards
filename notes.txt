So... this web app should have the ability for you to:

1. Make your own flash cards
2. Make your own flash card quizzes
3. Delete/edit your flash cards
4. Make multiple choice quizzes
5. Take notes
6. Create class categories
7. Create/change account, change account settings.
8. Possibly do oauth.
9. Search for keywords in your macro group of flashcards
10. Search for keywords within one group of flashcards
11. Have a "general" category for lazy people who just want to get one set of cards quickly
12. Have the ability to move flashcards back and forth between categories.
13. Have a "comprehensive" where you can review ALL random flashcards for one class/semester.

BUGS:

1. When removing a note, the blank text of the new note is visible. 
2. Logging in doesn't do anything yet.
3. The homepage should take you somewhere. 
4. When you create a note, it should also give you the time. --DONE
5. On mobile, the screen moves weirdly.
6. "Saving" the note doesn't do anything.
7. If there is no note, typing should create a new note. --DONE
8. There should be placeholder for the text --DONE
9. The behavior for adding flashcards is strange, doesn't work right if there are zero?
10. The router should handle going to an id or page that doesn't exist.
