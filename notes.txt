So... this web app should have the ability for you to:

1. Make your own flash cards
2. Make your own flash card quizzes
3. Delete/edit your flash cards
4. Make multiple choice quizzes
5. Take notes
6. Create class categories
7. Create/change account, change account settings.
8. Possibly do oauth.
9. Search for keywords in your macro group of flashcards
10. Search for keywords within one group of flashcards
11. Have a "general" category for lazy people who just want to get one set of cards quickly
12. Have the ability to move flashcards back and forth between categories.
13. Have a "comprehensive" where you can review ALL random flashcards for one class/semester.
